<u></u><u></u>you wake up one spring morning at the base of an oak tree

[[yawn-&gt;Intro 2]]<u></u><u></u>you don&#39;t remember how you got here, or how long you&#39;d been asleep

[[where did you say i was?-&gt;Intro 3a]]<u></u><u></u>also...

[[?-&gt;Intro 3b]]<u></u><u></u>but you were that anyway before you went to sleep

[[oh-&gt;Intro 5]]<u></u><u></u>cause you happen to be a tardigrade

[[say what now?-&gt;Title Screen]]<u></u><u></u>(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;<wbr>X=&quot;)[#a tardigrade&#39;s tale
a game of partial scientific accuracy
by Joshitha Muthukrishnan]
(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[[[<wbr>play-&gt;Scene 1a]]]<u></u><u></u>...

[[..?-&gt;Intro 3c]]<u></u><u></u>you&#39;re half a millimeter long

[[what-&gt;Intro 4]]<u></u><u></u>so yeah
you&#39;re a &quot;tardigrade&quot; now


if i wanted to get nerdy, i&#39;d say
you&#39;re a microscopic creature of the phylum Tardigrada
commonly known as moss piglets or water bears


but you don&#39;t care about any of that
you&#39;re just a nameless eight-legged microanimal
maybe your name is Tara or Didi or Grady though, i dunno

[[ok-&gt;Scene 1b]]<u></u><u></u>by the way, this is you
&lt;img src=&quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReliQuandary/CSC-281-Interactive-Fiction/master/Images/Tardigrade%25201.png&amp;source=gmail-html&amp;ust=1631972896852000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG_pKx9-cCB57FhTf9VSAGKKgWWkA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://raw.<wbr>githubusercontent.com/<wbr>ReliQuandary/CSC-281-<wbr>Interactive-Fiction/master/<wbr>Images/Tardigrade%201.png</a>&quot; alt=&quot;A tardigrade.&quot;&gt;

[[sweet-&gt;Scene 1c]]
[[ew-&gt;Scene 1d]]<u></u><u></u>speaking of survival...
you get the feeling you had entered the tun state for this trip

given that you&#39;re perfectly healthy and unharmed
apart from being confused
...and in a completely different location than you remember

[[what state? so weird-&gt;Scene 1f]]<u></u><u></u>well... it is a big ol&#39; oak tree
though you can&#39;t really tell that from your vantage point near the roots

the bark is extremely rough up close and looks more like a rugged mountain landscape from where you are

might be a bit dangerous to traverse, but you never know unless you try

[[no risk no reward, let&#39;s try moving higher up the tree-&gt;Scene 4a]]
[[that ain&#39;t good i wanna try a different option-&gt;Scene 1g]]<u></u><u></u>yesss that&#39;s the whole point of a text adventure!

you set off along a tree root into the great unknown

you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re going, but that&#39;s ok
it&#39;s all about the journey anyway

...now if only you weren&#39;t half a millimeter long...

[[this is gonna take a while isn&#39;t it-&gt;Scene 5a]]<u></u><u></u>okay but what do tardigrades eat anyway?
and like how would you go about finding food?

hmm, actually
there appears to be a particularly juicy group of bacteria not too far away
close even for a tardigrade

there&#39;s something weird about the surface they&#39;re on though

[[there is such a thing as a free lunch-&gt;Scene 7a]]
[[too good to be true, backtrack-&gt;Scene 1h]]<u></u><u></u>fun fact: &quot;tardigrade&quot; means something like &quot;slow steppers&quot;
so, uh, you&#39;re not moving very fast

the sap of the tree clings tightly to your legs, which doesn&#39;t help either

[[i&#39;m pretty patient-&gt;Ending 1b]]<u></u><u></u>(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[<wbr>#thanks for playing!]
(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[play again?]
(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[[[<wbr>restart from title screen-&gt;Title Screen]]
[[restart from intro-&gt;Intro 1]]]<u></u><u></u>(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[<wbr>#you&#39;re ~~dead~~ still alive]
(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[(<wbr>just, uh, incapacitated for the foreseeable future)]

(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[[[<wbr>well that&#39;s just splendid-&gt;Restart 2]]]<u></u><u></u>you keep at it, struggling with all your microscopic might

...but you&#39;re well and truly trapped

[[dangit-&gt;Ending 1c]]<u></u><u></u>since you weren&#39;t going anywhere anyway...

you undergo anhydrobiosis
which just means you dehydrate yourself and turn back into a tun before the sap hardens into amber

you&#39;re not dead (yet), cause tardigrades are pretty tough to kill
but you can&#39;t do anything either

[[sigh-&gt;Ending 1d]]<u></u><u></u>chin up... at least your eternal prison is a lovely translucent golden?

maybe someday you&#39;ll be in a museum
(only you&#39;re so tiny that&#39;d only happen if you got trapped with something more interesting)

or maybe your rock will be polished and you&#39;ll be a bead in a bracelet
(assuming you&#39;re not part of what gets polished off)

...not helping?

[[nooooooo-&gt;Restart 1a]]<u></u><u></u>aw oh well
might be an acquired taste

a surprising number of people actually find critters like you adorable
hence the cutesy nicknames

the looks aren&#39;t everything though
tardigrades are admirably tough and resilient and can survive a LOT of stuff
like all mass extinctions EVER (count &#39;em: five)

[[ok then-&gt;Scene 1e]]<u></u><u></u>haha i know right?

what you saw is pudgy perfection honed over millions of years of evolution
that body is born to SURVIVE

like, your folks got through all five mass extinctions without a scratch

[[woo i&#39;m invincible-&gt;Scene 1e]]<u></u><u></u>in any case... you think you&#39;ve been asleep for a pretty long while
but what matters is that you&#39;re now ready to seize the day!
seems a good time to stretch all eight of your legs

so, what are you going to do now? 

true you&#39;re a tiny creature in a humongous world
but you&#39;re pretty much indestructible
besides, what&#39;s the worst that could happen?


[[think i&#39;mma check out my surroundings, don&#39;t want to miss exploring right under my snout-&gt;Scene 2a]]
[[spent a ton of time as a tun, i wanna go out there and find a real adventure-&gt;Scene 2b]]
[[feeling kinda peckish, i want to find something to eat-&gt;Scene 2c]]<u></u><u></u>the day of the launch finally arrives
you are SO ready
your whole life has been leading up to this moment

the rocket (and you) fight against gravity to get free from the earth that binds you
you&#39;re getting closer and closer to the outer atmosphere
sections of the rocket begin to fall away

i guess you could say your whole life was leading up to your death, yeah
the surface of the rocket got a little too hot for you

[[ow-&gt;Restart 1f]]<u></u><u></u>you tumble away from the rocket, still clinging to what you thought was the perfect hiding place
you feel betrayed

you also feel a bit disoriented...
like the world&#39;s growing strangely small around you

or maybe you&#39;re just getting larger
...and larger
...and LARGER

you must be the size of like the sun by now
maybe bigger

if you could see yourself, you would notice that the surface of your body has begun to gleam with an iridescent light

[[oooh shiny-&gt;Ending 4b]]<u></u><u></u>(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[<wbr>#you have ascended]
(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[you are omnipotent and invincible now
all hail]

(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[[[<wbr>BOW BEFORE ME, MORTALS-&gt;Restart 2]]]<u></u><u></u>when you&#39;re a tun, you look kinda like a shriveled, curled-up ball

the tun state&#39;s basically a tardigrade&#39;s pause button
you enter a dormant state
often by dehydrating yourself enough that you lose up to 99% of your body&#39;s water
your metabolism goes down to less than 1/10000 of its normal value

then you wait as the world changes around you
possibly decades

and you rehydrate and resume living once the conditions are habitable

that&#39;s probably why you&#39;re awake on top of these nice comfortable tree roots

[[whoa okay-&gt;Scene 1g]]<u></u><u></u>you get free of your former vehicle
but find yourself in great danger of being frozen in ice

so you just decide to undergo cryobiosis
which means you turn into a tun that can survive the water in your cells freezing

some tardigrades can survive temperatures as low as -200 °C

now all you do is wait

[[ugh fine-&gt;Ending 5b]]<u></u><u></u>you let yourself float in the void, unconscious
after who knows how long later, you come to

you are on a planet that appears to be devoid of much life
... but there do seem to be some delicious mosses around

you decide to settle down and start a family
no you didn&#39;t find the perfect tardigrade
you happen to be a species that can just clone itself
and you live happily ever after for the next few months

tardigrades only live like 30 months at most

[[short but sweet-&gt;Ending 6b]]<u></u><u></u>as the wind dies down, you see that you are floating above what appears to be a launch site for the next rocket to space

you never really wanted to go to space

before you witnessed the majesty of that glorious rocket in the middle of the site

maybe they could take you on as some kind of mascot?

[[let&#39;s check it out anyway-&gt;Scene 6b]]<u></u><u></u>you very slowly make your way up along the side of the tree
eventually, a nice moist forest of lichen comes into view
exactly what a terrestrial tardigrade such as yourself likes to live in
(and also eat)
would be nice to take a closer look

however your path is blocked by a deposit of sticky sap on the tree trunk
it doesn&#39;t look easy to cross

what are you going to do?

[[i must know what is up there-&gt;Ending 1a]]
[[nope going back down now-&gt;Scene 4b]]<u></u><u></u>you keep trudging along...

at least the weather&#39;s nice

[[there is a pleasant breeze-&gt;Scene 5b]]<u></u><u></u>you decide to cut your losses and head all the way back down the oak tree

[[much exercise-&gt;Scene 1h]]<u></u><u></u>after much struggle, you&#39;re right back where you woke up
at least you&#39;re still alive?

what now?

[[check out my surroundings-&gt;Scene 2a]]
[[go out and find a real adventure-&gt;Scene 2b]]
[[find something to eat-&gt;Scene 2c]]<u></u><u></u>you keep on going, you know not why...

really though, you have no idea what you&#39;re heading into
sure you want to keep going that way?

[[yup i&#39;ve come this far, sunk cost fallacy be darned-&gt;Scene 5c]]
[[nope heading back kinda want to live-&gt;Scene 5d]]<u></u><u></u>la la la~
still just a tardigrade trudging along
nothing interesting happens

[[grumble-&gt;Scene 5e]]<u></u><u></u>you decide to leave the venturing into the great unknown for another time

[[yeah maybe later-&gt;Scene 1h]]<u></u><u></u>that pleasant breeze you were feeling decides to pick up...
aaand now you are dealing with the tardigrade equivalent of gale force winds

a gust carries you high into the air and far away from your tree

the change of pace is welcome though

[[WHEEEEEEE-&gt;Scene 6a]]
[[AHHHHHHH-&gt;Scene 6a]]<u></u><u></u>looks like some of the space center&#39;s employees are on their lunch break
suppose it doesn&#39;t feel as windy to them, seeing as they&#39;re eating outdoors and nothing&#39;s flying off the picnic tables

this is your big chance to really make it to space
on that glorious rocket standing in plain view

who should you try and float to?
i&#39;m sure they won&#39;t mind a harmless little creature like you coming along for the ride

[[the maintenance person-&gt;Scene 6f]]
[[the nuclear scientist-&gt;Scene 6d]]
[[the astronaut-&gt;Scene 6e]]<u></u><u></u>you decide to tag along with the maintenance person

looks like their job right now is inspecting the outside of the rocket
you could probably stow away in one of those nooks or crannies

[[ooh how exciting-&gt;Scene 6g]]<u></u><u></u>you decide to tag along with the nuclear scientist

they&#39;re in charge of the experimental fission fuel source this rocket is using
they&#39;re running a last few rounds of tests before launch arrives
important stuff goes on in the test chamber

they close the door to the shielded lead-walled chamber...
trapping you inside

that&#39;s fine though
tardigrades can withstand 1000 times more radiation than other animals

[[wonder if i&#39;ll mutate and get superpowers?-&gt;Scene 6h]]<u></u><u></u>you decide to tag along with the astronaut

you spend many happy days hiding inside their ear
honored to be joining them on this epic journey

as final preparations are made, you tuck yourself into their spacesuit
you&#39;re basically a real astronaut now

[[what an opportunity-&gt;Scene 6i]]<u></u><u></u>you find a small gap between parts that you can squeeze yourself into

you then revert to the tun state
eagerly waiting until launch day

tardigrades can survive in space no problem

[[my life is too much waiting-&gt;Ending 2a]]<u></u><u></u>the tests weren&#39;t that painful really
you were still relatively protected from the heat generated

you latch on to the fuel source as it&#39;s transported from the lab to the rocket
you know it definitely can&#39;t hurt you now, so you decide to stay there
it&#39;s as good a place as any to stow away

[[science says so-&gt;Scene 6j]]<u></u><u></u>launch goes off without a hitch
this plan is so perfect
nothing has gone wrong

you join them for their first real spacewalk
they can&#39;t not call you a real astronaut at this point!

...especially after you tumbled away from their spacesuit into the vacuum of space
didn&#39;t tuck yourself in quite well enough
you&#39;ll survive cause you&#39;re a tun, but there goes your ride home

[[aw and it was so perfect-&gt;Ending 6a]]<u></u><u></u>knowledge about everything everywhere floods your mind, temporarily stunning you
...maybe that radioactivity did mutate something

is this what it&#39;s like to be a god?

[[now we know-&gt;Restart 1b]]<u></u><u></u>score!
you are now in possession of a delicious-looking bacterium

it&#39;s no full course meal with plants and algae and mosses and nematodes
but you take what you can get

this place still looks suspicious though
it&#39;s better you take your catch elsewhere to eat

[[ok-&gt;Scene 7b]]<u></u><u></u>huh
you can&#39;t move
your claws seem to have been caught on... something

knew that surface was fishy

...it&#39;s a shoelace
attached to a shoe
being worn by a person
who is now beginning to walk away...

at least you still have your lunch

[[didn&#39;t think this was what takeout meant-&gt;Scene 7c]]<u></u><u></u>once you&#39;re done ingesting that juicy bacterium
and made many fruitless efforts to get free

you decide to curl up into a ball as best you can
be a tun for a while
check back later

maybe something interesting will have happened by then

[[that&#39;s one way to travel-&gt;Scene 8a]]<u></u><u></u>when you revive yourself, you find that you&#39;re in an entirely unfamiliar place
the air is warm and humid and salty
the shoe you&#39;ve been riding is standing on a nicely-polished wooden floor
looks like you&#39;re on a pretty big ship

your claws seem to have gotten less stuck during the trip so far
you have regained your freedom and can now float unhindered!
though it&#39;s been pretty cozy here on this shoelace...
and if you wait around on the ship you could travel much further
see the world and all that

[[time to bail, this is a great place to get off-&gt;Scene 8b]]
[[i&#39;ll bide my time until we get someplace really cool-&gt;Scene 8c]]<u></u><u></u>you think the balmy weather of the Pacific Ring of Fire suits you just fine
so you let the breeze float you away

sure is nice up here
a beautiful view of the sand, the sea
and the tourist traps

it might just be you, but the volcanic activity of the region seems to give the air a comforting warmth

[[woo island paradise-&gt;Scene 8d]]<u></u><u></u>you enjoy a lovely cruise
undeterred by the increasingly frigid temperatures as you travel towards the Arctic

...until your ship loses a headbutting match with an iceberg
you and your shoelace person are going down

[[this story sounds familiar-&gt;Ending 5a]]<u></u><u></u>(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[<wbr>#you have survived]
(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[it&#39;s probably just you and other tardigrades now]

(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[[[<wbr>the planet is ours-&gt;Restart 2]]]<u></u><u></u>(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[<wbr>#you founded an entire civilization]
(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[<wbr>Terra Tardigrada is way better than Earth ever was]

(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[[[we have proven ourselves superior-&gt;Restart 2]]]<u></u><u></u>30 years later, you find you&#39;ve been unfrozen
also literally all the ice has been unfrozen

turns out humanity kinda sorta destroyed the world while you were napping

so you&#39;re one of the only living beings (all tardigrades of course) left on the planet

cool.

[[lonely but thriving-&gt;Restart 1c]]<u></u><u></u>you seem to be getting closer to the lava flows

tardigrades can survive temperatures of up to 151 °C
so it couldn&#39;t hurt to sightsee a little while you&#39;re here

you keep going that way

[[glowy fire rivers!-&gt;Ending 7a]]<u></u><u></u>you are now so close to the glowy fire rivers
their glowiness is magnificent
their fire is sublime

maybe sublime&#39;s not the right word

you don&#39;t happen to be in a tun state at the moment
you were too distracted by the glowy
...turns out some terms and conditions apply to your invincibility

the last thing you see is magnificent glowiness

[[NOW YOU TELL ME--&gt;Restart 1e]]<u></u><u></u>(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[<wbr>#you were fried to a crisp]
(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[such is life]

(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[[[i have no regrets-&gt;Restart 2]]]<u></u><u></u>(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[<wbr>#you have burned up in the atmosphere]
(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[<wbr>extreme heat can do that to you]

(align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)[[[<wbr>that doesn&#39;t count as traveling to space does it-&gt;Restart 2]]]<u></u><u></u>launch day comes and you are all tunned up and ready to go

the acceleration was a bit jarring at first
but it wasn&#39;t anything you couldn&#39;t handle

you feel a sense of satisfaction as the crew declares that the rocket has gotten to space
you feel a sense of dread as the crew declares that the spent fuel sources will be jettisoned

[[uh oh i&#39;m on one of those-&gt;Ending 4a]]<u></u><u></u>after millennia of evolution, your descendants have established their own technologically-advanced tardigradoid civilization
you are honored as their founder though your name is unknown
you are immortalized in their memory as The Lifegiver
forevermore

[[guess i can live with that-&gt;Restart 1d]]<u></u><u></u>
